# Expedite Ventures - The CTO Angel Network

[Expedite Ventures](https://www.expedite.ventures) is a business angel group of CTOs and CPOs. We invest in tech founders and help them to create sustainable businesses through both capital and in-depth, hands-on mentoring.

We are nerds at heart and passionate founders ourselves - many of us are still running startups. Our true hands-on mentoring approach is based on decades of collective experience in building and scaling technology companies â€“ which we think is at least as valuable as funding.

We encourage those who are already engineering today's technology to get into the driver's seat and become first-time founders. Our goal is especially to support underrepresented groups in tech, including female and immigrant entrepreneurs.
